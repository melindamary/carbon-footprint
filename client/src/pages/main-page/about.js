                        <p>
                        The carbon footprint is commonly expressed as the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) 
                        and is meant to sum up the total greenhouse gas emissions (not just carbon dioxide) caused by economic activities,
                        events, organizations, services etc.  It includes direct emissions, such as those that result from fossil-fuel combustion in manufacturing, 
                        heating, and transportation, as well as emissions required to produce the electricity associated with 
                        goods and services consumed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Every aspect of your operations, from energy consumption and transportation to waste management and supply chain activities, 
                        contributes to your carbon footprint. Your corporate footprint is a measure of sustainability.

                        <h2>Corporate carbon footprint and its impact</h2>
                        <p>As major economic players, corporations have an important role to play here â€“
                         both as developers of new solutions and as users of them. As the effects of climate change have come into
                        focus in recent years, there has been increasing pressure on organizations to reduce their carbon footprints 
                        and address climate change. A growing number of corporates are vocal about their 
                         commitment to cutting their carbon footprints. What is driving this? There are several motivating factors.
                          Reporting around sustainability and other environmental issues are increasingly mandated.</p>
